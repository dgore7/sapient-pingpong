**An Instrumented Ping-Pong Platform**

Sapient Pingpong is an instrumented ping-pong platform developed by the 2016
SapientNitro Chicago summer technology interns, Wesley Hampson and David
Gorelik. The platform is built with Node.js and Express on the back-end and
React on the front-end. It also includes a Windows 10 IoT app, written in C#,
for reading data from users' RFID cards and posting the data to a URL, which is
used for signing in.
